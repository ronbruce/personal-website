        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hello world, my name is Ron and I am a multi-talented, creative and
          innovative programmer. You can also address me as a web developer,
          software developer or software engineer. I'm also multi-displinary
          with over a decade of experience in a wide randge of disciplines from
          graphic design, art, education, music and more.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a junior web developer, my goal is to help companies with their
          websites by debugging and maintaining their site. The main langauges
          in my tech stack are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and rescently, React. I am
          a avid learner who loves learning new things. Currently, I am taking
          the Introduction to Computer Science at Harvard and the Front-end
          Development course on Coursera.
        </p>

        <p>
          The skills I learned as a creative individual are transferrable. For
          example, I don't mind sitting for hours learning a new feature or
          technology the same way I don't mind doing it when learning a song on
          guitar. The same creative critical thinking process I use for writing
          a song, I apply it when debugging or coming up with creative ways to
          solve programming related problems. With that being said, I believe
          that my skills does not define me, but its my personality that makes
          me special and that determines my effectiveness as a professional.
        </p>
        <h3>Work experience</h3>
        <p>
          In 2022 I interned at Google as a Software Developer where I learned
          the fundamentals to computer science, Java, and web development. I
          also got one on one mentorship with senior developers at Google and
          participated in a live coding session with a cohort of 90 people. In
          addition, I learned how to use Github, git commands, Kaban board,
          API's, IndexedDB to name a few.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I spent the year working on a capstone project with a
          team of junior developers like my self under the supervision of senior
          engineers. We built an expense tracker app that allows an individual
          to manage their finances.
